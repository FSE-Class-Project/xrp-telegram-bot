# XRP Telegram Bot - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ü§ñ Getting Started

### Q: How do I start using the XRP Telegram Bot?
**A:** Simply message the bot and use the `/start` command. The bot will automatically:
- Create a secure XRP TestNet wallet for you
- Fund your wallet with 1000 TestNet XRP
- Set up your account with default settings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational Note:** This automated wallet creation is for **TestNet learning only**. Real-world MainNet wallets require manual setup, secure key management, and purchasing XRP from exchanges.

### Q: Is this real XRP or test currency?
**A:** The bot operates on **XRP TestNet only**. All XRP used is test currency with **no real monetary value**. This is a safe environment for learning and testing XRP transactions.

### Q: Do I need to provide my own XRP wallet?
**A:** No! The bot automatically creates a secure wallet for each user. Your private keys are encrypted and stored securely.

## üí∞ Wallet & Balance

### Q: How do I check my XRP balance?
**A:** Use the `/balance` command or click the "üí∞ Check Balance" button in any menu. You'll see:
- Total XRP balance
- Available balance (after reserved amounts)
- Current USD value
- Your wallet address

### Q: Why is my available balance less than my total balance?
**A:** XRP Ledger requires a minimum reserve of 10 XRP per account. This reserve cannot be spent and ensures your account remains active on the network.

### Q: Can I add more XRP to my wallet?
**A:** On TestNet, you can request additional test XRP from the faucet. For real implementations, you would need to deposit XRP from an external wallet or exchange.

## üí∏ Sending XRP

### Q: How do I send XRP to someone?
**A:** Use the `/send` command in two ways:

**Quick Send:**
```
/send 10 rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96
```

**Interactive Send:**
```
/send
> Enter amount: 10
> Enter address: rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96
> Confirm: YES
```

### Q: What's the minimum/maximum I can send?
**A:** 
- **Minimum:** 0.000001 XRP (1 drop)
- **Maximum:** Your available balance minus the 10 XRP reserve
- **Fees:** Each transaction costs ~0.00001 XRP in network fees

### Q: How do I know if my transaction was successful?
**A:** The bot will show you:
- ‚úÖ Transaction confirmation with hash
- Updated balance
- Transaction details (amount, recipient, timestamp)
- Link to view on XRP Ledger explorer

### Q: Can I cancel a transaction?
**A:** **It depends on timing:**

‚úÖ **Before Network Submission:**
- Use `/cancel` command during transaction setup
- Click "‚ùå Cancel" or "NO" buttons in confirmation prompts  
- Full cancellation support until you confirm "YES"

‚ùå **After Network Submission:**
- XRP Ledger transactions are **irreversible** once submitted to the network
- Network confirmation takes ~3-5 seconds on both TestNet and MainNet
- No cancellation possible once blockchain processing begins

üí° **Real-World Note:** On MainNet, the cancellation window is extremely brief (seconds) compared to TestNet's leisurely interaction time. Always double-check recipient address and amount before final confirmation.

## üìä Price & History

### Q: How do I check the current XRP price?
**A:** Use the `/price` command to see:
- Current XRP price in USD
- 24-hour price change
- Market data from CoinGecko

### Q: How do I view my transaction history?
**A:** Use the `/history` command to see:
- All your sent and received transactions
- Transaction amounts and dates
- Recipient/sender addresses
- Transaction status and confirmations

### Q: How far back does transaction history go?
**A:** The bot stores your complete transaction history from when you first started using it. There's no time limit on historical data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Profile

### Q: How do I view or change my settings?
**A:** Use `/settings` to access:
- üîî Price alerts (get notified of major price changes)
- üì± Transaction notifications 
- üí± Currency display preferences
- üîê Security settings
- üóëÔ∏è Account deletion

### Q: Can I delete my account?
**A:** Yes, use `/settings` ‚Üí "Delete Account". This will permanently remove:
- Your wallet and private keys
- All transaction history
- Personal settings and data
- Cached information

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Account deletion is irreversible!

### Q: How do I view my profile information?
**A:** Use `/profile` to see:
- Account details (name, username, join date)
- Wallet information (address, balance)
- Current settings overview

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

### Q: How secure is my wallet?
**A:** Very secure:
- Private keys are encrypted using industry-standard Fernet encryption
- Keys are never transmitted in plain text
- Database is secured with proper authentication
- All API calls use authenticated endpoints

### Q: What if I lose access to Telegram?
**A:** Since the bot manages your wallet, losing Telegram access means losing wallet access. For production use, we'd recommend:
- Backup seed phrases
- Export wallet capabilities  
- Account recovery options

### Q: Can the bot developers see my private keys?
**A:** Private keys are encrypted in the database. While technically possible with database access, the system is designed with security best practices to minimize this risk.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Q: The bot isn't responding to my commands
**A:** Try these steps:
1. Check if the bot is online
2. Restart the conversation with `/start`
3. Wait a few seconds and try again
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Q: My transaction is stuck or pending
**A:** XRP Ledger transactions typically confirm within 3-5 seconds. If stuck:
1. Check transaction status with `/history`
2. Verify the recipient address was valid
3. Ensure you had sufficient balance
4. Contact support with the transaction details

### Q: I'm getting an "insufficient funds" error
**A:** This means:
- Your available balance is too low (remember the 10 XRP reserve)
- You're trying to send more than you have
- Network fees would exceed your balance
- Check `/balance` to see your available funds

### Q: The bot says "network error" or "connection failed"
**A:** This indicates:
- Temporary XRP Ledger network issues
- Bot server maintenance
- Internet connectivity problems
- Try again in a few minutes

### Q: I can't validate an XRP address
**A:** Valid XRP addresses:
- Start with 'r' (classic addresses) or 'X' (X-addresses)
- Are exactly 25-34 characters long
- Use Base58 encoding
- Example: `rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96`

## üéì Educational Information

### Q: What is XRP Ledger?
**A:** XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community. It's designed for payments and currency exchange, with fast settlement times (3-5 seconds) and low transaction costs.

### Q: What's the difference between TestNet and MainNet?
**A:** 
- **TestNet:** Testing environment with fake XRP (no real value)
- **MainNet:** Live network with real XRP (actual monetary value)
- This bot uses **TestNet only** for safe learning

### Q: How does this bot differ from real-world XRP usage?
**A:** **Key differences for educational purposes:**

üîß **Wallet Management:**
- **This Bot:** Automatic wallet creation and key management
- **Real World:** Manual wallet setup, user controls private keys, hardware wallets recommended

üí∞ **Funding:**
- **This Bot:** Automatic 1000 TestNet XRP funding via faucet
- **Real World:** Purchase XRP from exchanges, transfer to personal wallets

‚è±Ô∏è **Transaction Timing:**
- **This Bot:** Leisurely confirmation process on TestNet  
- **Real World:** 3-5 second confirmation window, immediate finality

üîê **Security:**
- **This Bot:** Educational-grade security, keys stored in bot database
- **Real World:** Military-grade security, hardware wallets, air-gapped systems

üí∏ **Consequences:**
- **This Bot:** Risk-free learning environment
- **Real World:** Real money, irreversible transactions, regulatory compliance

### Q: How do XRP transactions work?
**A:** 
1. You initiate a transaction with recipient address and amount
2. The bot signs the transaction with your encrypted private key
3. Transaction is submitted to XRP Ledger TestNet
4. Network validates and processes the transaction (~3-5 seconds)
5. Transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain

### Q: What are XRP "drops"?
**A:** The smallest unit of XRP. 1 XRP = 1,000,000 drops. This allows for precise micropayments and fee calculations.
