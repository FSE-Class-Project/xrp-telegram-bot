# XRP Telegram Bot - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ü§ñ Getting Started

### Q: How do I start using the XRP Telegram Bot?

**A:** Simply message the bot and use the `/start` command. You'll get two
wallet options:

#### Option 1: Auto-Create Wallet (Recommended)

- Bot creates a secure XRP TestNet wallet for you
- Automatically funds wallet with TestNet XRP from faucet
- Perfect for new users and learning

#### Option 2: Import Existing Wallet (Advanced)

- Import your own TestNet wallet using private key/seed phrase
- Multiple safety checks prevent MainNet wallet imports
- For users who want to use existing TestNet wallets

‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety First:** This bot is for **TestNet learning only**. Wallets with
MainNet funds are automatically rejected.

### Q: Is this real XRP or test currency?

**A:** The bot operates on **XRP TestNet only**. All XRP used is test currency
with **no real monetary value**. This is a safe environment for learning and
testing XRP transactions.

### Q: Do I need to provide my own XRP wallet?

**A:** You have two options:

1. **Auto-Create (Recommended):** The bot creates a secure TestNet wallet for you
2. **Import Existing:** Import your own TestNet wallet (with strict safety checks)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Only TestNet wallets are supported. Wallets with MainNet
funds will be automatically rejected for your safety.

## üí∞ Wallet & Balance

### Q: How do I check my XRP balance?

**A:** Use the `/balance` command or click the "üí∞ Check Balance" button in any
menu. You'll see:

- Total XRP balance
- Available balance (after reserved amounts)
- Current USD value
- Your wallet address

### Q: Why is my available balance less than my total balance?

**A:** XRP Ledger requires a minimum reserve of 1 XRP per account. This reserve
cannot be spent and ensures your account remains active on the network.

### Q: Can I add more XRP to my wallet?

**A:** On TestNet, you can request additional test XRP from the faucet. For real
implementations, you would need to deposit XRP from an external wallet or
exchange.

## üí∏ Sending XRP

### Q: How do I send XRP to someone?

**A:** Use the `/send` command in two ways:

#### Quick Send

```text
/send 10 rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96
```

#### Interactive Send

```text
/send
> Enter amount: 10
> Enter address: rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96
> Confirm: YES
```

### Q: What's the minimum/maximum I can send?

**A:**

- **Minimum:** 0.000001 XRP (1 drop)
- **Maximum:** Your available balance minus the 1 XRP reserve
- **Fees:** Each transaction costs ~0.00001 XRP in network fees

### Q: How do I know if my transaction was successful?

**A:** The bot will show you:

- ‚úÖ Transaction confirmation with hash
- Updated balance
- Transaction details (amount, recipient, timestamp)
- Link to view on XRP Ledger explorer

### Q: Can I cancel a transaction?

**A:** **It depends on timing:**

#### Before Network Submission

‚úÖ

- Use `/cancel` command during transaction setup
- Click "‚ùå Cancel" or "NO" buttons in confirmation prompts
- Full cancellation support until you confirm "YES"

#### After Network Submission

‚ùå

- XRP Ledger transactions are **irreversible** once submitted to the network
- Network confirmation takes ~3-5 seconds on both TestNet and MainNet
- No cancellation possible once blockchain processing begins

üí° **Real-World Note:** On MainNet, the cancellation window is extremely
brief (seconds) compared to TestNet's leisurely interaction time. Always
double-check recipient address and amount before final confirmation.

## üìä Price & History

### Q: How do I check the current XRP price?

**A:** Use the `/price` command to see:

- Current XRP price in USD
- 24-hour price change
- Market data from CoinGecko

### Q: How do I view my transaction history?

**A:** Use the `/history` command to see:

- All your sent and received transactions
- Transaction amounts and dates
- Recipient/sender addresses
- Transaction status and confirmations

### Q: How far back does transaction history go?

**A:** The bot stores your complete transaction history from when you first
started using it. There's no time limit on historical data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Profile

### Q: How do I view or change my settings?

**A:** Use `/settings` to access:

- üîî Price alerts (get notified of major price changes)
- üì± Transaction notifications
- üí± Currency display preferences
- üîê Security settings
- üóëÔ∏è Account deletion

### Q: Can I delete my account?

**A:** Yes, use `/settings` ‚Üí "Delete Account". This will permanently remove:

- Your wallet and private keys
- All transaction history
- Personal settings and data
- Cached information

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Account deletion is irreversible!

### Q: How do I view my profile information?

**A:** Use `/profile` to see:

- Account details (name, username, join date)
- Wallet information (address, balance)
- Current settings overview

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety

### Q: How secure is my wallet?

**A:** Very secure:

- Private keys are encrypted using industry-standard Fernet encryption
- Keys are never transmitted in plain text
- Database is secured with proper authentication
- All API calls use authenticated endpoints

### Q: What if I lose access to Telegram?

**A:** Since the bot manages your wallet, losing Telegram access means losing
wallet access. For production use, we'd recommend:

- Backup seed phrases
- Export wallet capabilities  
- Account recovery options

### Q: What safety measures prevent MainNet wallet imports?

**A:** Multiple layers of protection:

- **Balance Checking:** We check both TestNet and MainNet for existing funds
- **Automatic Rejection:** Wallets with MainNet XRP are blocked using these thresholds:
  - MainNet balance >0.1 XRP: **BLOCKED**
  - MainNet balance >20 XRP: **BLOCKED** (high-value wallet protection)
  - TestNet balance >10,000 XRP: **WARNING** (suspicious test balance)
- **Clear Warnings:** Multiple warning screens before import
- **Validation Logging:** All import attempts are logged for security monitoring

### Q: Can the bot developers see my private keys?

**A:** Private keys are encrypted in the database. While technically possible
with database access, the system is designed with security best practices to
minimize this risk.

**A:** Valid XRP addresses:

- Start with 'r' (classic addresses) or 'X' (X-addresses)
- Are exactly 25-34 characters long
- Use Base58 encoding
- Example: `rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqDtD2XZzWjfrn96`
